  o Minor features (SOCKS):
    - Detect invalid SOCKS5 username/password combinations according to
      new extended parameters syntax.  (Currently, this rejects any
      SOCKS5 username beginning with "<torS0X>", except for the username
      "<torS0X>0". Such usernames are now reserved to communicate additional
      parameters with other Tor implementations.)
      Implements proposal 351.
