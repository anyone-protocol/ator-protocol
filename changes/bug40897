  o Major bugfixes (TROVE-2023-007, exit):
    - Improper error propagation from a safety check in conflux leg
      linking lead to a desynchronization of which legs were part of
      a conflux set, ultimately causing a UAF and NULL pointer
      dereference crash on Exit relays. Fixes bug 40897;
      bugfix on 0.4.8.1-alpha.
