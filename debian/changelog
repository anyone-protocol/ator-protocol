tor (0.4.6.5-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version, fixing several (security) issues (closes: #990000).
    For a full list see the upstream changelog.  It includes:
    - Don't allow relays to spoof RELAY_END or RELAY_RESOLVED cell on
      half-closed streams. Previously, clients failed to validate which
      hop sent these cells: this would allow a relay on a circuit to end
      a stream that wasn't actually built with it.
      Bugfix on 0.3.5.1-alpha. This issue is also tracked as TROVE-2021-
      003 and CVE-2021-34548.
    - Detect more failure conditions from the OpenSSL RNG code.
      Previously, we would detect errors from a missing RNG
      implementation, but not failures from the RNG code itself.
      Fortunately, it appears those failures do not happen in practice
      when Tor is using OpenSSL's default RNG implementation.
      Bugfix on 0.2.8.1-alpha. This issue is also tracked as
      TROVE-2021-004. Reported by Jann Horn at Google's Project Zero.
    - Resist a hashtable-based CPU denial-of-service attack against
      relays. Previously we used a naive unkeyed hash function to look
      up circuits in a circuitmux object. An attacker could exploit this
      to construct circuits with chosen circuit IDs, to create
      collisions and make the hash table inefficient. Now we use a
      SipHash construction here instead. Bugfix on
      0.2.4.4-alpha. This issue is also tracked as TROVE-2021-005 and
      CVE-2021-34549. Reported by Jann Horn from Google's Project Zero.
    - Fix an out-of-bounds memory access in v3 onion service descriptor
      parsing. An attacker could exploit this bug by crafting an onion
      service descriptor that would crash any client that tried to visit
      it. Bugfix on 0.3.0.1-alpha. This issue is also
      tracked as TROVE-2021-006 and CVE-2021-34550. Reported by Sergei
      Glazunov from Google's Project Zero.

  * tor-geoipdb: change from priority extra to optional as the former is
    obsolete.
  * Set Standards-Version to 4.4.0.
  * The fix for #930113, runit support, added an /etc/tor/conf to
    set the ulimit -n when run under runit.  That directory is a bad place.
    It confuses users, nowhere is it apparent that only runit cares about that
    directory and that e.g. sysV or systemd don't.   Get rid of that
    directory and the MAX_FILEDESCRIPTORS file in it and set a reasonable
    default in the runit script if MAX_FILEDESCRIPTORS is not already set.

    Use the patch provided there, except also fix the backporting scripts,
    change the somewhat low number of FDs to 65536, change a variable
    name as to not suggest this has anything to do with tor authority
    directory servers.

      put in the outbuf. Previously, KIST acted as though the outbuf
      were empty, which could lead to the outbuf becoming too full. It
      is possible that an attacker could exploit this bug to cause a Tor
      client or relay to run out of memory and crash. Fixes bug 29168;

tor (0.3.2.6-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version, including among others:
    - Fix a denial of service bug where an attacker could use a
      malformed directory object to cause a Tor instance to pause while
      OpenSSL would try to read a passphrase from the terminal. (Tor
      instances run without a terminal, which is the case for most Tor
      packages, are not impacted.) Fixes bug 24246; bugfix on every
      version of Tor. Also tracked as TROVE-2017-011 and CVE-2017-8821.
      Found by OSS-Fuzz as testcase 6360145429790720.
    - Fix a denial of service issue where an attacker could crash a
      directory authority using a malformed router descriptor. Fixes bug
      24245; bugfix on 0.2.9.4-alpha. Also tracked as TROVE-2017-010
      and CVE-2017-8820.
    - When checking for replays in the INTRODUCE1 cell data for a
      (legacy) onion service, correctly detect replays in the RSA-
      encrypted part of the cell. We were previously checking for
      replays on the entire cell, but those can be circumvented due to
      the malleability of Tor's legacy hybrid encryption. This fix helps
      prevent a traffic confirmation attack. Fixes bug 24244; bugfix on

      and CVE-2017-8819.
    - Fix a use-after-free error that could crash v2 Tor onion services
      when they failed to open circuits while expiring introduction
      points. Fixes bug 24313; bugfix on 0.2.7.2-alpha. This issue is
      also tracked as TROVE-2017-013 and CVE-2017-8823.
    - When running as a relay, make sure that we never build a path
      through ourselves, even in the case where we have somehow lost the
      version of our descriptor appearing in the consensus. Fixes part
      of bug 21534; bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha. This issue is also tracked
      as TROVE-2017-012 and CVE-2017-8822.

tor (0.3.2.3-alpha-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Recent linux packages in Debian have enabled the apparmor
    Linux-Security-Module by default.  Therefore, users are likely to have
    apparmor support not only built into their kernel but also actively
    enabled at runtime.  Unfortunately, without the apparmor package
    being installed, systemd's AppArmorProfile= service setting will
    cause the unit to fail to start.
    .
    Change "AppArmorProfile=system_tor" to AppArmorProfile=-system_tor,
    causing all errors while switching to the new apparmor profile to
    be ignored.  This is not ideal, but for now it's probably the
    best solution.
    .
    Thanks to intrigeri; closes: #880490.

    changed with 0.3.0.4-rc-1.  This change will allow tor to start
    again under apparmor if hidden services are configured.
    Patch by intrigeri.  (closes: #862993)
  * Remove tor-dbg binary package.  Nowadays Debian's toolchain
    automatically builds packages containing debugging symbols.  The new
    tor-dbgsym package will end up in the debian-debug archive.
    This tor-dbgsym package will Replace/Break tor-dbg versions
    prior to 0.3.1.5-alpha for now, but as we keep providing backported
    builds for older suites, and since those keep the tor-dbg package for now,
    we'll likely keep increasing this version in future releases.

    changelog says that Tor changed some logic with 0.2.8.1-alpha that made
    CAP_CHOWN CAP_FOWNER no longer needed.
    CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE is still needed: Tor checks properties of hidden service
    directories as root before changing its UID to debian-tor, and those trees
    are owned by debian-tor and go-rwx (see #847598).

      directories.
    - Use the RelaxDirModeCheck option for the control unix domain socket
      so that works.
    - tor-instance-create: in the torrc we create, append to the SocksPort
      list using + instead of overriding what is configured in the defaults

tor (0.2.4.12-alpha-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * No longer change tor manpage to be in section 8.
  * No longer move tor from usr/bin to /usr/sbin after make install.
    We now install tor into the same place as upstream.  Having it in
    the default user path makes it easier for users who want to run
    tor themselves.
  * Install a compatibility symlink in /usr/sbin.
  * Change relation form from (< version) to (<< version) in the tor-geoip
    package.
  * Update debian/watch file.
  * Clean up old /etc/tor/tor-tsocks.conf conffile (closes: #705785).
    This requires debhelper >= 8.1.0~, adapt build-dependency accordingly.

tor (0.2.4.9-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Build-Conflict with libnacl-dev so that we don't pull it in accidentally.
    For now Tor doesn't manage to use it on at least amd64 anyway, but that
    may change.  We should review this decision once we know how things work
    and where we want to use nacl.
  * Move the geoip6 file to the tor-geoip package (spotted by George
    Kargiotakis)
  * add appropriate Replaces and Breaks to the tor-geoip package for
    tor < 0.2.4.8 since we moved a file to tor-geoip.
  * If $DAEMON $VERIFY_ARGS fails, call use the same arguments for
    finding the errors and not $DAEMON --verify-config.

  * New upstream version:
    - Fix a group of remotely triggerable assertion failures related to
      incorrect link protocol negotiation. Found, diagnosed, and fixed
      by "some guy from France". Fix for CVE-2012-2250; bugfix on
      0.2.3.6-alpha.
    - Fix a denial of service attack by which any directory authority
      could crash all the others, or by which a single v2 directory
      authority could crash everybody downloading v2 directory
      information. Fixes bug 7191; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.
    - and more.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Fri, 26 Oct 2012 09:17:33 +0200

tor (0.2.4.4-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    o Major bugfixes (security/privacy, also in 0.2.3.23-rc):
      - Disable TLS session tickets. OpenSSL's implementation was giving
        our TLS session keys the lifetime of our TLS context objects, when
        perfect forward secrecy would want us to discard anything that
        could decrypt a link connection as soon as the link connection
        was closed. Fixes bug 7139; bugfix on all versions of Tor linked
        against OpenSSL 1.0.0 or later. Found by Florent Daignière.
      - Discard extraneous renegotiation attempts once the V3 link
        protocol has been initiated. Failure to do so left us open to
        a remotely triggerable assertion failure. Fixes CVE-2012-2249;
        bugfix on 0.2.3.6-alpha. Reported by "some guy from France".
    o And more.  For details please see the upstream changelog.
  * Add debian/source.lintian-overrides for
    rc-version-greater-than-expected-version, similar to what we have for
    the binary packages.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Oct 2012 11:52:48 +0200

tor (0.2.4.3-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Remove debian/patches/02_add_debian_files_in_manpage which hasn't been
    enabled for over five years now.
  * Update and fix a minor whitespace issue in
    debian/patches/14_fix_geoip_warning.
  * remove obsolete debian/TODO file.
  * Use dh_lintian to install the override file for tor-geoipdb.  Requires
    changing debhelper build dependency to >= 6 from >= 5, and renaming
    debian/tor-geoipdb.lintian-override to tor-geoipdb.lintian-overrides.
  * Use dh_link to create the /usr/share/doc/tor-dbg -> tor symlink in
    tor-dbg.  Also call dh_link before dh_install*, so that nothing creates a
    /usr/share/doc/tor-dbg directory.
  * No longer call dh_link with arguments to create the
    /usr/share/man/man5/torrc.5 -> ../man8/tor.8 symlink in the tor package,
    instead create and populate debian/tor.links accordingly.
  * Call configure with --disable-silent-rules, so we actually see what
    the build did in a log.
  * Try to patch upstream's documenation build system so it does what we want
    rather than duplicating parts of it in debian/rules.  This will fix a bug
    where we would end up with empty .html documentation if building from the
    source source tree more than once.
  * Upstream no longer installs /usr/bin/tor-control.py, so no need to remove
    it in debian/rules.
  * No longer try to symlink the changelogs for tor-geoipdb from the tor
    package.  Frist, this has been broken as dh_installchangelogs stomps all
    over our symlinks.  Second, the tor and tor-geoipdb package may be of
    different versions, so a symlink is probably the wrong thing in the
    first place.
  * Add lintian overrides for all three binary packages for
    rc-version-greater-than-expected-version.  Tor's version scheme is sane.

tor (0.2.3.21-rc-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version, changes including:
    - Tear down the circuit if we get an unexpected SENDME cell. Clients
      could use this trick to make their circuits receive cells faster
      than our flow control would have allowed, or to gum up the network,
      or possibly to do targeted memory denial-of-service attacks on
      entry nodes.
    - Reject any attempt to extend to an internal address. Without
      this fix, a router could be used to probe addresses on an internal
      network to see whether they were accepting connections.
    - Do not crash when comparing an address with port value 0 to an
      address policy.
    For details please see the upstream changelog.

tor (0.2.3.20-rc-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version, including a couple security fixes:
    - Avoid read-from-freed-memory and double-free bugs that could occur
      when a DNS request fails while launching it. Fixes bug 6480.
    - Avoid an uninitialized memory read when reading a vote or consensus
      document that has an unrecognized flavor name. This read could
      lead to a remote crash bug. Fixes bug 6530.
    - Try to leak less information about what relays a client is
      choosing to a side-channel attacker.
  * Suggest the tor-arm controller.
  * Improve long descriptions with Roger's help.
  * Use https:// instead of git:// for the Vcs-Git URL.

tor (0.2.3.18-rc-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Remove debian/patches/15_longer_test_timeout - something similar has been
    incorporated upstream (Re: Tor#6227).
  * Re-enable apparmor, if available:  Instead of confining /usr/sbin/tor by
    default, we now only confine the daemon that is launched from the init
    script.  We do this by calling aa-exec with the appropriate flags, if it
    is installed.  Therefore also suggest apparmor-utils.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Fri, 29 Jun 2012 12:03:30 +0200

tor (0.2.3.17-beta-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply the correct SE-Linux label to /var/run/tor when creating the
    directory in the init script (closes: #678362).  Thanks to Russell Coker.
  * Hack up the unit tests to wait longer for the thread test to finish.
    This is not a real fix, but it will probably make it more likely that
    we successfully build on our mips/octeon machines (Re: Tor#6227).

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Sun, 24 Jun 2012 16:13:35 +0200

tor (0.2.3.17-beta-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Shipping and enabling the apparmor policy by default causes Tor to
    break for users who have apparmor enabled in enforcind mode and
    that, either in addition to or instead of running Tor as a system
    service (i.e. /etc/init.d/tor), also run Tor as their user or in
    some other means like launched from vidalia.  Therefore:
    .
    - No longer install apparmor policy by default.  It can be found in
      /usr/share/doc/tor if anybody is interested.
    - No longer build-depend on dh-apparmor, or suggest apparmor.
    - Also, clean up and remove old /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.tor files
      on upgrade if they have not been changed by the user.
    .
    These changes relate to Debian Bug #670525 and fixes Tor ticket #6188.

tor (0.2.3.17-beta-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * apparmor policy:
    - allow access to /var/log/tor/* and not just /var/log/tor/log*,
  * No longer create /var/run/tor in postint if it does not exist -
    the init script should take care of that.
  * Change the output of the init script to use lsb* functions:
    - Depend on lsb-base.
    - Makes the output pretty (closes: #676843)
  * Also, in the init script we are now less verbose, unless VERBOSE is
    set to yes in /etc/default/rcS (see the rcS(5) manual page):
    - pass --hush to tor on startup, so only warnings and errors are
      displayed, hiding any notice level log output,
    - do not report raising ulimit -n.

tor (0.2.3.16-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.
    - Work around a bug in OpenSSL that broke renegotiation with TLS
      1.1 and TLS 1.2. Without this workaround, all attempts to speak
      the v2 Tor connection protocol when both sides were using OpenSSL
      1.0.1 would fail. Resolves ticket 6033.
    - and more - please consult upstream changelog.
  * Include apparmor profile.  Thanks to intrigeri (closes: #670525).

    of existing users (closes: #658358).
  * Include 45ace4844b020cb754d3bb65f1021bfeb5115f9e from master

    - use config_find_option_mutable() instead of config_find_option()
      if we're going to mess with the return value,
    - Correctly declare functions as having no arguments instead of not
      telling the compiler which arguments it'll have.
  * Suggest tor-arm (closes: #640265).
  * Downgrade socat and polipo|privoxy to Suggests (closes: #640264).

tor (0.2.3.3-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Upload to experimental now that 0.2.2.x is out of rc and was uploaded to
    unstable.
  * Merged from debian-0.2.2: 0.2.2.29-beta-1
    - The postinst script changes /var/run/tor to mode 02750 if it exists,
      but the tor init script creates it with mode 02700 if it doesn't.
      Change the init script to also create the directory with a group
      writeable mode, the same as the postinst maintainer script, i.e. 02750.
      .
      This will allow users in the debian-tor group to access the control
      socket (re: #552556).
    - Enable Control Socket by default.  It lives in /var/run/tor/
      (closes: #552556).
  * Update context in patches/06_add_compile_time_defaults.
  * Forward port patches/07_log_to_file_by_default.

tor (0.2.2.24-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Forward port missing changes from the 0.2.1.x tree:
    - Add ${misc:Depends} for all three binary packages because debhelper
      might want to add stuff  [tor 0.2.1.26-1].
    - tor.postinst: Stop calling stat(1) with its full path  [tor 0.2.1.26-1].
    - No longer set ulimit -c to unlimited:
      Up until now the init script (or actually /etc/default/tor) raised
      the ulimit for coredumps to unlimited, so that Tor would produce
      coredumps on assert errors or segfaults.  Coredumps however can
      leak sensitive information, like cryptographic session keys and
      clients' data should the core files get into the wrong hands.  As
      such it seems prudent to only enable coredumps if the user or
      operator explicitly asks for them, and knows what to do with them.
      [tor 0.2.1.26-2]
    - Also include a cron.weekly job that removes old coredumps from
      /var/lib/tor.  This action can be disabled in /etc/default/tor.
      [tor 0.2.1.26-2]
    - Make sure the cronjob does not try to access a /var/lib/tor
      that has already been removed (due to for instance package removal).
      Thanks to Holger and piuparts for catching this.

tor (0.2.2.21-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=high

  * New upstream version, including several security related fixes.  See
    upstream changelog for details.  Addresses CVE-2011-0427.
  * Forward port patches/03_tor_manpage_in_section_8.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Jan 2011 18:40:27 +0100

tor (0.2.2.20-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=high

  * New upstream version.
    - Fix a remotely exploitable bug that could be used to crash instances
      of Tor remotely by overflowing on the heap. Remote-code execution
      hasn't been confirmed, but can't be ruled out (CVE-2010-1676).
  * Since the dawn of time (0.0.2pre19-1, January 2004, initial release
    of the debian package), the postinst script has changed ownership and
    permissions of various trees like /var/lib/tor, /var/run/tor, and
    /var/log/tor, sometimes recursively.
    .
    It turns out this actually is a security issue, so try to be more
    conservative when fixing up modes and only chown/chgrp
    /var/{lib,log,run}/tor directly, never recursively.
  * Remove /var/run/tor, recursively, on purge.  We already do this
    for /var/lib/tor and /var/log/tor.

tor (0.2.2.19-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    - remove debian/patches/15_tlsext_host_name (already included in new
      upstream version).

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Nov 2010 13:46:10 +0100

tor (0.2.2.18-alpha-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * If we overwrite src/or/micro-revision.i in during build,
    clean it out in the clean target.
  * Add debian/patches/15_tlsext_host_name: Work around change in libssl0.9.8
    (0.9.8g-15+lenny9 and 0.9.8o-3), taken from 0.2.1.27 (closes: #604198):
    .
    Do not set the tlsext_host_name extension on server SSL objects; only on
    client SSL objects.  We set it to immitate a browser, not a vhosting
    server. This resolves an incompatibility with openssl 0.9.8p and openssl
    1.0.0b.  Fixes bug 2204; bugfix on 0.2.1.1-alpha.

tor (0.2.2.16-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Downgrade torsocks/tsocks dependency to a recommends.  That tool
    is not needed if you only run a relay, or if you access Tor only
    using polipo or privoxy.  The torify(1) wrapper that makes use
    of torsocks or tsocks already handles their absense and emmits a
    proper message telling the user what they are missing (closes: #595898).
  * Remove suggests of mixminion which is no longer in the archive
    (closes: #594207), and also of anon-proxy which appears to not
    have been updated in at least two years.
  * Add xul-ext-torbutton to suggests.

tor (0.2.2.14-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    Among many other things:
    - New config option "WarnUnsafeSocks 0" disables the warning that
      occurs whenever Tor receives only an IP address instead of a
      hostname. Setups that do DNS locally over Tor are fine, and we
      shouldn't spam the logs in that case. (Closes: #497466)

tor (0.2.2.10-alpha-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * In /etc/default/tor also source /etc/default/tor.vidalia if it exists
    and if vidalia is installed.  We do this so that the vidalia package
    can override some of our settings: People who have vidalia installed might
    not want to run Tor as a system service. The vidalia .deb can ask them
    that and then set run-daemon to no.

tor (0.2.2.10-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * debian/rules:
    - make manpage building properly depend on patch-stamp,
    - Fix building in the absence of a debian/micro-revision.i file.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Tue, 09 Mar 2010 14:06:48 +0100

tor (0.2.2.9-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    - We no longer need to build-depend on a recent libssl-dev because
      Tor now detects whether we need to explicitly turn on
      autonegotiation at run-time rather than compile time.  Good.
      (This also means we no longer need to conflict with newer
       libssls when we built against an old one on backports.)
    - The manpages are now built with asciidoc.  While the upstream
      tarball already ships with the output of asciidoc, we instead
      build the manpages during package build time so we can patch them.
      + Therefore build-depend on asciidoc (>= 8.2), docbook-xml,
        docbook-xsl, and xmlto.
      + update 03_tor_manpage_in_section_8 to patch the .txt files now.
      + Remove tor.1.in torify.1.in tor-gencert.1.in tor-resolve.1.in in
        the doc directory during clean.
      + And try to work around missing (and if it wasn't, broken)
        build-system for the manpages.
      + The torify.1 manpage gets installed by upstream, no longer need
        to do it manually in debian/rules.
    - The original design paper is no longer shipped with Tor.
      + Remove debian/hexdump-*.pdf (which we used to work around
        fig2dev bugs).
      + No longer build the paper in debian/rules, and remove it from
        debian/tor.docs.
      + No longer build-depend on texlive-base-bin, texlive-latex-base,
        texlive-fonts-recommended, transfig and ghostscript.
    - Upstream tarballs no longer ship an AUTHORS file, or the website,
      Removed these from debian/tor.docs.  No longer shipping parts of
      the website also closes: #443560.
    - Also no longer distribute doc/TODO and doc/HACKING in the debian
      package.
  * Move from comm to section net, where it might fit slightly better
    (closes: #482801).
  * Ship contrib/tor-exit-notice.html in the tor package (put it into
    usr/share/doc/tor; closes: #568934).
  * Add stark README.polipo with the instructions from Juliusz Chroboczek.
    (closes: #413730)
  * 0.2.2.4-alpha failed to ship test.h so we had included it in the
    debian diff.  The upstream bug has long since been fixed so we should
    probably stop shipping our own copy of test.h.
  * Finally apply Peter Eisentraut's patch for tor's init script to support
    status as an argument (closes: #526371).

tor (0.2.2.7-alpha-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Minor cleanup (use a single variable for making up our
    configure flags, not two).
  * debian/rules: Remove logic that ignores the result of unit tests if
    localhost does not resolve (or not to 127.0.0.1).  This should no
    longer be necessary as our build chroots have gotten a lot better.
  * Depend on and enable hardening-includes for building.

tor (0.2.2.7-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=medium

      and gabelmoo.
    [and more]

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Wed, 20 Jan 2010 19:29:08 +0100

tor (0.2.2.6-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=low

    - Drop debian/patches/0a58567c-work-with-reneg-ssl.dpatch
      (part of upstream).

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Mon, 23 Nov 2009 18:52:04 +0100

tor (0.2.2.5-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Pick 0a58567ce3418f410cf1dd0143dd3e56b4a4bd1f from master git tree:
    - work with libssl that has renegotiation disabled by default.
    (debian/patches/0a58567c-work-with-reneg-ssl.dpatch)
  * Therefore build-depend on libssl-dev >= 0.9.8k-6.  If we build against
    earlier versions we will not work once libssl gets upgraded to a version
    that disabled renegotiations.
  * Change order of recommends from privoxy | polipo to polipo | privoxy.
  * Allegedly echo -e is a bashism.  Remove it from debian/rules, we don't
    need it anyways (closes: #478631).
  * Change the dependency on tsocks to torsocks | tsocks (see: #554717).

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Nov 2009 11:04:02 +0100

tor (0.2.2.4-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * The testsuite moved from src/or/test to src/test/test,
    but let's call it using "make check" now.
  * Upstream failed to ship src/test/test.h.  Ship it in debian/ and
    manually copy it in place during configure and clean up in clean.
    Let's not use the patch system as this will most likely be rectified
    by next release.

tor (0.2.2.2-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * The files src/common/common_sha1.i src/or/or_sha1.i get changed
    during the build - they contain the checksums of the individual
    files that end up in the binary.  Of couse changes only end up
    in the debian diff.gz after building a second time in the same
    directory.  So, remove those files in clean to get both a cleaner
    diff.gz and idempotent builds.
  * If we have a debian/micro-revision.i, replace the one in src/or
    with our copy so that this will be the revision that ends up in
    the binary.  This is an informational only version string, but
    it'd be kinda nice if it was (more) accurate nonetheless.
    .
    Of course this won't help if people manually patch around but
    it's still preferable to claiming we are exactly upstream's source.
    .
    If we are building directly out of a git tree, update
    debian/micro-revision.i in the clean target.

tor (0.2.1.16-rc-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * No longer inform the user if/when we re-create the /var/run/tor
    directory in the init script.  With /var/run on tmpfs this is
    completely normal now so our message was just noise.
  * Stop shipping /var/run/tor in the package.
  * Only clean up permissions of /var/run/tor in postinst if the
    directory actually exists.
  * Update Standards-Version from 3.8.0 to 3.8.1.  No real changes
    required, we already support nocheck in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS since
    August 2004, and we already create our var/run directory in the
    init script (tho we now no longer ship it either - see above).
  * Change debhelper compatibility version from 4 to 5:
    - Change dh_strip call from --dbg-package=tor
      to --dbg-package=tor-dbg.
    - Update versioned build time dependency on debhelper.

     - Fix a temporary DoS vulnerability that could be performed by
       a directory mirror (closes: #514580).
  * patches/06_add_compile_time_defaults: Only set the User option in
    the config if we run as root.  Do not set it when run as debian-tor
    as Tor then always insists on changing users which will fail.  (If
    we run as any other user we don't set our debian defaults anyway.)

    proper DH_OPTIONS options.  This is taken from the template
    that dh_make nowadays uses for multi-binary packages.
  * Unit tests are broken, yay.
  * Use ${binary:Version} to depend on the right tor binary package from
    the tor-dbg package instead of ${Source-Version}.  Some guy on the
    internet said the latter was deprecated.
  * Add Homepage: https://www.torproject.org/ field to control file.
  * And mention www.tp.o instead of the old tor.eff.org in the long
    description.
  * No longer ignore failure of make clean in the clean target.
  * Support passing of parallel=<n> in build options.
  * Change declared Standards-Version to 3.8.0.

    - move /var/lib/tor/keys/secret_onion_key out of the way.
    - move /var/lib/tor/keys/secret_onion_key.old out of the way.
    - move /var/lib/tor/keys/secret_id_key out of the way if it was

      libssl was uploaded to Debian unstable.

    on the number of system-wide available file descriptors:
    /proc/sys/fs/file-max is bigger than 80k, set ulimit -n to 32k, if it's
    greater than 40k set the limit to 16k, and when greater than 10k our limit
    shall be 8k descriptors.  If there are less than 20k FDs in the entire
    system default to a limit of only 1024.

    Big servers at the moment regularly use more than 10k FDs, so our old
    default of 8k no longer is sufficient.  On the other hand we don't want
    lower end systems to run out of FDs on Tor's account.
  * If we run as root also apply debian defaults.
  * Add User=debian-tor and Group=debian-tor to debian defaults.  That allows
    us to start Tor as root and have it setuid/setgid to the target user.
  * Change the init script to start Tor as root.  Now we should be able to
    bind to low port.

tor (0.2.0.18-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * postinst: Remove the check that requires the debian-tor user
    to have a uid between 100 and 999.  There is no good reason
    to require this.  If the local admin moves the system users/uid-space
    to some other range then they probably have a good reason for that.
  * postinst: change wording if debian-tor's homedir is wrong, do not
    print anything if it is ok.
  * postinst: We were only fixing the permissions of /var/{lib,run,log}/tor
    when we were not upgrading.  Unfortunately the check doesn't work all
    that well usually in cases where the package was removed (not purged)
    and then later re-installed again.  Now we ensure proper ownership
    and modes for all the directories and files below /var/{lib,run,log}/tor
    (the dirs themselves included) every time we run postinst.
  * postinst: if we reboot between unpacking and configuring on some smart
    systems this will mean that we just lost /var/run/tor - creating it
    in the maintainer script if it doesn't exist.
  * Create logfiles in logrotate so that they come into the world with the
    correct mode (o-r).

    Should we also do this when they try to run their Tor as any other
    (non root, non debian-tor) user? - add 11_tor_as_root_more_helpful

    - New IP for tor26 directory server,
    - fix a possible double-free in tor_gzip_uncompress,
    - and more (see upstream changelog).

tor (0.1.0.11-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version (closes: #316753):
    - Fixes a serious bug: servers now honor their exit policies -
      In 0.1.0.x only clients enforced them so far.  0.0.9.x is
      not affected.
  * Build depend on libevent-dev >= 1.1.
  * Urgency high because 0.0.9.10-1 did not make it into testing after
    like 3 weeks because of an impending ftp-master move.  So I might
    just as well upload this one.

tor (0.1.0.10-0.pre.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Add a watch file.
  * Forward port 03_tor_manpage_in_section_8.
  * Forward port 06_add_compile_time_defaults.
  * Add libevent-dev to build-depends.
  * Update URL to tor in debian/control and debian/copyright.
  * Add a snippet to disable epoll in etc/default/tor, commented out.
  * Add a snippet to set nice level in etc/default/tor.
  * Wait for 60 seconds in init stop.  35 is too little.
  * Don't depend on python anymore - tor-resolve is C now.
  * If "with-dmalloc" is in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS we build against libdmalloc4.
    Of course the -dev package needs to be installed.
  * Update README.Debian to say that upstream now does have a default
    for DataDirectory.
  * Don't fail in the init script when we cannot raise the ulimit.
    Instead just warn a bit (closes: #312882).

tor (0.0.9.10-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * While we're waiting for a newer libevent to enter sid, make another
    upload of the 0.0.9.x tree:
    - Refuse relay cells that claim to have a length larger than the
      maximum allowed. This prevents a potential attack that could read
      arbitrary memory (e.g. keys) from an exit server's process
      (CVE-2005-2050).

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Thu, 16 Jun 2005 22:56:11 +0200

tor (0.0.9.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.

tor (0.0.9.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Upstream used newer auto* tools, so hopefully the new config.sub
    and config.guess files (2003-08-18) are good enough to build
    tor on ppc64 (closes: #300376: FTBFS on ppc64).

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Mar 2005 01:34:28 +0100

  * New upstream version.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Thu, 24 Feb 2005 09:45:52 +0100

tor (0.0.9.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Set ulimit for file descriptors to 4096 in our init
    script.
  * Use SIGINT to shutdown tor.  That way - if you are a server -
    tor will stop accepting new connections immediately, and
    give existing connections a grace period of 30 seconds in
    which they might complete their task.  If you just run a
    client it should make no difference.

tor (0.0.8+0.0.9rc7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (candidate).
    For real this time.  Looks like our rc6 orig.tar.gz
    was in fact the rc5 one.
  * forward port patches/07_log_to_file_by_default

tor (0.0.8+0.0.9rc6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (candidate).
    - cleans up more integer underflows that don't look exploitable.
      But one never knows (-> medium).
  * Remove those 'date' calls in debian/rules again that were
    added in rc5-1.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Dec 2004 11:11:23 +0100

tor (0.0.8+0.0.9rc5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (candidate).
    - medium because it fixes an integer overflow that might
      be exploitable, but doesn't seem to be currently.
  * Add a few 'date' calls in debian/rules, so I can see how long
    building the docs take on autobuilders.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Wed,  1 Dec 2004 10:02:08 +0100

tor (0.0.8+0.0.9pre5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Symlink tor(8) manpage to torrc(5).
  * Make logs readable by the system administrators (group adm).
  * Point to /var/log/tor (the directory) instead of a single
    file (/var/log/tor/log) in the debian patch of the manpage.
  * Do not patch the default torrc to include settings we really want.
    Instead modify the compiled in default options.  Those settings are

    - RunAsDaemon is enabled by default.
    - PidFile is set to /var/run/tor/tor.pid.  No default upstream.
    - default logging goes to /var/log/tor/log instead of stdout.
    - DataDirectory is set to /var/lib/tor by default.  No default upstream.

    This is also documented in the new debian/README.Debian.
  * Remove /usr/bin/tor-control.py from the binary package, it is
    not really useful yet, and wasn't meant to be installed by
    default.
  * Change init startup script to properly deal with tor
    printing stuff on startup.

  * Make sure all patches apply cleanly.
  * No longer use --pidfile, --logfile, and --runasdaemon
    command line options.  Set them in the configfile instead.
  * Change the description slightly, to say "don't rely on the current Tor
    network if you really need strong anonymity", instead of "Tor will not
    provide anonymity currently".

    go over tor.
